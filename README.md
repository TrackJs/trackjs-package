TrackJS Browser Agent
===============

The browser agent for collecting errors from JavaScript, Network, and console
exceptions. The agent wraps the browser API to record context about your
appliaction, network, and visitor, and include that context when unhandled
errors occur.

You'll need a TrackJS account to use this agent. If you don't have one, [why not

## Quick Start

1. [Signup for TrackJS](https://trackjs.com/signup) and get your token.
2. Add a dependency on TrackJS with `npm install trackjs --save`
3. Install the agent in your app. You can paste the script tags into the
`<head>` of your HTML:

```html
<script src="PATH_TO_TRACKJS/t.js"></script>
<script>
  TrackJS.install({ token: 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' });
</script>
```

Or you can bundle it as a module into your application.

```javascript
import { TrackJS } from 'trackjs';
TrackJS.install({ token: 'YOUR_TOKEN_HERE' });
```

4. Test it out by calling `TrackJS.track('testing!')` somewhere in your
application.
5. You should see your error on [TrackJS](https://my.trackjs.com/recent) within
a few seconds.
